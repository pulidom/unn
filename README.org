** State and Covariance prediction for dynamical systems with RNNs in Pytorch


This code is based on the works by Salinas et al. and Sacco et al. While a Salinas work predict mean and variance, this code predicts the fullcovariance matrix prediction based on Sacco et al.


Code was based on  <a href="https://github.com/husnejahan/DeepAR-pytorch"> DeepAR-pytorch </a>
