** Uncertainty quantification in dynamical systems with neural networks



*** State and Covariance prediction for dynamical systems with RNNs in Pytorch


This code is based on the works by Salinas et al. and Sacco et al. While a Salinas work predict mean and variance, this code predicts the full covariance matrix prediction based on Sacco et al.


Code was based on  [[https://github.com/husnejahan/DeepAR-pytorch][DeepAR-pytorch]]
